## Breast Cancer Classification with Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a simple neural network for breast cancer classification. The neural network is designed to analyze breast cancer data and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* Python (>=3.6)
* TensorFlow (>=2.0)
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

### Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the neural network is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

## Results

After training, the model's performance metrics will be displayed, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
